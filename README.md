#### Q-2. A chemist had two chemical flasks labeled 0 and 1 which consist of two different chemicals. He extracted 3 features from these chemicals in order to distinguish between them, you provided the results derived by the chemicals and your task is to create a model that will label chemical 0 or 1 given its three features and built-in docker and use some library to display that in frontend.Dataset This is the Dataset You can use this dataset for this question.

### About Dataset

#### Context
Patients with Liver disease have been continuously increasing because of excessive consumption of alcohol, inhale of harmful gases, intake of contaminated food, pickles and drugs. This dataset was used to evaluate prediction algorithms in an effort to reduce burden on doctors.

#### Content
This data set contains 416 liver patient records and 167 non liver patient records collected from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. The "Dataset" column is a class label used to divide groups into liver patient (liver disease) or not (no disease). This data set contains 441 male patient records and 142 female patient records.

Any patient whose age exceeded 89 is listed as being of age "90".

#### Columns:

- Age of the patient
- Gender of the patient
- Total Bilirubin
- Direct Bilirubin
- Alkaline Phosphotase
- Alamine Aminotransferase
- Aspartate Aminotransferase
- Total Protiens
- Albumin
- Albumin and Globulin Ratio
Dataset: field used to split the data into two sets (patient with liver disease, or no disease)
